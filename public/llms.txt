# Tippa

> Non-custodial cascading payments on the Stellar network. When the root gets paid, the foundation gets funded.

Tippa lets anyone receive payments and automatically split them across configured recipients — atomically, in a single Stellar transaction. No intermediaries, no custody, no trust required.

## What is Tippa?

Tippa is a decentralized payment-splitting platform built on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. Users register a username on-chain and configure a cascade of recipients with percentage-based splits. Anyone can send USDC or XLM to a Tippa user's payment page without needing a Tippa account themselves — only a Stellar wallet (e.g. Freighter, xBull).

Example flow:
- Bob sends 100 USDC to trytippa.com/d/alice
- Alice receives 64.50 USDC
- Recipient A receives 15.00 USDC
- Recipient B receives 10.00 USDC
- Recipient C receives 10.00 USDC
- Tippa fee: 0.50 USDC
- All-or-nothing. One transaction. Settled in under 5 seconds.

## Key Features

- **Cascade payments**: Automatically split any incoming payment across up to 10 configured recipients
- **Atomic transactions**: All splits happen in a single Stellar transaction — it either fully succeeds or fully reverts
- **Non-custodial**: Private keys never leave the user's wallet; Tippa never holds funds
- **No account required to send**: Senders only need a Stellar wallet — no sign-up, no KYC
- **Username registration**: On-chain usernames registered via Soroban smart contract
- **Multiple assets**: Supports USDC and XLM

## How Cascading Works

1. A user registers a username on-chain via a Soroban smart contract
2. They configure cascade recipients — each with a Stellar wallet address and a percentage share
3. They share their payment link: `trytippa.com/d/<username>`
4. When a sender visits the page, connects their wallet, and sends funds, the Soroban contract atomically distributes the payment to all recipients in one transaction
